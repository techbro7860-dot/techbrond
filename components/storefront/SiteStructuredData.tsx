/**
 * Site-wide structured data, rendered once in the storefront layout.
 *
 * Organization tells search engines who is behind the site, which matters
 * disproportionately when you are asking strangers to send you five-figure
 * payments. WebSite with a SearchAction lets Google show a search box for
 * the site in results.
 *
 * Nothing here is aspirational. No aggregateRating, no fabricated review
 * count, no awards. Emitting rating markup with nothing behind it is the
 * fabricated-testimonial problem in machine-readable form — Google penalises
 * it, and the compliance notes rule it out anyway.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDERS: replace the phone number and social profiles with real ones,
 * or delete those keys. A `sameAs` pointing at an empty profile is worse
 * than omitting it.
