/**
 * POST /api/payments/stripe/webhook
 *
 * The only thing that confirms an international order. The browser
 * returning to /order-success confirms nothing — same rule as Razorpay.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO GET WRONG HERE:
 *
 * 1. The signature must be verified against the RAW body. Next.js gives
 *    parsed JSON from req.json(), and re-serialising it changes key order
 *    and whitespace, so every signature check fails. req.text() first,
 *    always.
 *
 * 2. `checkout.session.completed` fires when the session completes, which
 *    for most methods means paid — but for delayed methods it does not.
 *    payment_status is checked explicitly rather than assumed.
 *
 * 3. Return 2xx for anything already handled. Stripe retries non-2xx for
 *    days, and a webhook that errors on a duplicate turns one payment into
 *    a retry storm. confirmPayment is idempotent; this handler just has to
 *    not fight it.
