/**
 * DRAFT — have a lawyer review before launch.
 *
 * Written against what the application actually does rather than from a
 * template. Three things here are real commitments the code already
 * implements, and they should not be softened into vagueness:
 *
 *  - download logs are retained (Phase 4, DownloadLog is append-only)
 *  - deployment credentials are encrypted and deleted (Phase 5 purge job)
 *  - card details never reach our servers (Razorpay/Stripe hosted checkout)
 *
 * If any of those stop being true, this page has to change the same day.

          <strong className="font-medium text-ink">When you buy:</strong> name,
          email, phone, billing address, and GSTIN if you supply one. Indian tax
          law requires the billing state on the invoice, which is why it is not
          optional.

        <p>
          <strong className="font-medium text-ink">When you download:</strong>{" "}
          the time, your IP address and browser, against your licence. This is

            When you buy a deployment:

      <Clause title="What we never see">
        <p>
          Card numbers, UPI IDs and bank details. Payments run through Razorpay

          delete what we are not legally required to keep. Tax records are the
          exception, and we will say so plainly rather than quietly ignoring
          that part of a request.
