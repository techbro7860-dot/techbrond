 * Post-payment landing page.
 *
 * Carefully worded: it says the payment was submitted, not that the order is
 * confirmed. Confirmation happens in the gateway webhook, which may land a
 * second or two after the browser gets here — so a page that announces
 * "order complete" would be lying about a third of the time, and lying in
 * the direction that generates support tickets when the email is slower than
 * expected.
 *
 * No order details are shown, because this page is reachable by anyone with
 * the URL. The real record lives behind a login on the purchases page.
